    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
    <p><strong>Monoxide Dihydrogen</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or <em>DHMO<sup>1</sup></em>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>is the major component of acid rain</li>
        <li>contributes to the greenhouse effect</li>
        <li>may cause severe burns</li>
        <li>is fatal if inhaled</li>
        <li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape</li>
        <li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals</li>
        <li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes</li>
        <li>has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>as an industrial solvent and coolant</li>
        <li>in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup></li>
        <li>as a fire retardant</li>
        <li>in many forms of cruel animal research</li>
        <li>as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products</li>
        <li>in the distribution of pesticides</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical. <sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O. <sup>2</sup>Source: Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.</p>
